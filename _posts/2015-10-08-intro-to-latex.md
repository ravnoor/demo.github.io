Another grad student and I hosted a workshop on Introduction to LaTeX
today. We just went over the very basics, but the materials are online
[on my github](https://github.com/jabranham/latex-workshop). Feel free
to email me with questions or fork and make a pull request with
suggestions or improvements!
