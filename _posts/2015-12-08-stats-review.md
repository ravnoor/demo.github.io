I recently ran a review session for a graduate level statistics
course. This isn't meant to be a comprehensive guide to everything we
covered, but I figured that maybe someone would find it useful. It
goes through maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments
estimation. It also gives some examples for each of those. I also
wrote up a bit about statistical significance and power. If you're
interested, you can find the pdf
