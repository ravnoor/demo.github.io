I co-taught a workshop (with Daniel Weitzel) about how to use R. The
workshop was geared towards people who have seen R before, but aren't
comfortable using it. We walked through the basic workflow: importing
data, data manipulation, data merging, creating tables, and
visualization. 

In case others are interested, I've put the materials
[on github](https://github.com/jabranham/applied-r-for-social-scientists).
